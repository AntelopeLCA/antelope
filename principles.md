# Antelope Design Principles

Data sources used in life cycle assessment provide a variety of different types of information, and different use cases require different subsets of information.  The purpose of the Antelope framework is twofold:

 1. To identify separate types of data according to a consistent specification;
 2. To develop tools that make use of that specification to simplify the tasks of publishing and accessing data.

This package `antelope` contains the minimal interface specification.  It is accompanied by a separate, reference implementation ([antelope core](https://github.com/AntelopeLCA/antelope_core)) that can be used for research purposes.
