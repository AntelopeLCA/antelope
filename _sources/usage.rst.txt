Ways to use Antelope
--------------------

* **Benchmarking** - access reference data and retrieve metadata, exchanges, and run
  LCI and LCIA computations.
* **Model building** - Specify reference flows and dependent exchanges, and link them to data
  sources for computation.
* **Model Observation** - Given an existing model, make customizations that apply under different scenarios.
  Then, mix and match the scenarios to generate comparative results.
* **Model Running** - Traverse a model graph, computing a suite of life cycle impact indicator scores
  as you go along, grouping results according to a set of aggregation rules.
