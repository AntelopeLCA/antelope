Antelope LCA Software
=====================

Antelope is a cloud-based framework for accessing input data for life cycle assessment (LCA)
and generating results.  It is designed make minimal requirements on a user's computer, instead

The overall philosophy of Antelope is to reduce complexity by sub-dividing the LCA computation
into distinct sub-tasks that rely on different kinds of information.  These sets of sub-tasks
are called :doc:`interfaces` and
