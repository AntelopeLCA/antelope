"""
In most LCA software, a 'flow' is a composite entity that is made up of a 'flowable' (substance, product, 
intervention, or service) and a 'context', which is synonymous with an environmental compartment.

The US EPA review of elementary flows recommended managing the names of flowables and contexts separately, and that
is the approach that is done here.  

The exchange model consists of : parent | flow(able), direction | [exch value] | [terminal node]

If the terminal node is a context, the exchange is elementary. if it's a process, then intermediate. 
If none, then cutoff.

The new Flat Background already implements context-as-termination, but the main code has had to transition and we are 
still technically debugging the CalRecycle project. So we introduce this flag CONTEXT_STATUS_ to express to client code 
which one to do. It should take either of the two values: 'compat' means "old style" (flows have Compartments) and 
'new' means use the new data model (exchange terminations are contexts)

# LciaResults should negate values when an exchange direction and a context are not complementary (i.e. "Input" "to air")
